# Demand Forecasting Assignment 

This project focuses on forecasting the daily demand for lettuce in four individual restaurants of one of the largest US fast-food chains. The provided dataset encompasses transaction information, including purchased menu items and their quantities, ingredient lists for each item, and metadata on restaurants such as location and store type. The dataset descriptions can be found in the data_descriptions.pdf file. 

The project's objective was to assist restaurant managers in making inventory replenishment decisions by predicting the demand for lettuce in the upcoming two weeks (from 06/16/2015 to 06/29/2015). Two forecasting methods, namely Holt-Winters and ARIMA, will be utilized and compared to generate these predictions.
